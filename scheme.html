                <h3>Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT)</h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Improves urban infrastructure, including in rural-urban farming towns, to boost farming in semi-urban zones.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The AMRUT Mission is targeted at enhancing urban planning and infrastructure across India. While its primary focus is urban areas, it also significantly impacts rural-urban transitions and agricultural activities within urban areas. The scheme promotes eco-friendly city development with features like sewage systems, stormwater drainage systems, and wastewater treatment plants. It is aimed at building the capacities of urban regions to better handle rural-urban connections. For farmers, the focus is on enhancing the supporting infrastructure, enabling improved water management, sanitation, and resource-efficient farming in peri-urban zones. Additionally, rural farmers in towns are increasingly introduced to technological and infrastructural support.</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Enhance urban infrastructure that indirectly boosts sustainable farming practices within both rural and urban settings.</p>

                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A pension scheme to support small traders, benefiting rural farmers and agribusinesses.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Although primarily focused on traders, this scheme includes small-scale farmers and rural entrepreneurs. It offers a monthly pension scheme to help increase financial security for people operating in the informal sectors. By supporting small businesses that are integral to rural economies, this scheme indirectly assists farmers who are involved in agri-trading and related activities. It benefits small traders, handicraft workers, and others linked to agriculture and agri-processing sectors, helping them prepare for a future when they are unable to work. The scheme thus ensures income security and aids entrepreneurship in rural and agricultural spaces.</p>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Provide social security to the small and informal sector traders, ensuring the agricultural economy has access to financial safety.</p>
